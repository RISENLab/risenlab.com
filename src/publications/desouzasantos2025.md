Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) are rooted in the very origins of software engineering and are shaped by the contributions of many individuals from underrepresented groups to the field. Yet today, DEI efforts in the industry face growing resistance, with companies retreating from visible commitments and pushing back on initiatives started only a few years ago. Aims: This study explores how the DEI backlash is unfolding in the software industry by investigating institutional changes, lived experiences, and the strategies used to sustain DEI practices. Method: We conducted an exploratory qualitative study using 59 publicly available Reddit posts authored by self-identified software professionals. Data were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis. Results: Our findings show that software companies are responding to the DEI backlash in varied ways, including re-structuring programs, scaling back investments, or quietly continuing efforts under new labels. Professionals reported a wide range of emotional responses, from anxiety and frustration to relief and happiness, shaped by identity, role, and organizational culture. Yet, despite the backlash, multiple forms of resistance and adaptation have emerged to protect inclusive practices in software engineering. Conclusions: The DEI backlash is reshaping DEI in software engineering. While public messaging may soften or disappear, core DEI values persist in adapted forms. This study offers a new perspective on how inclusion is evolving under pressure and highlights the resilience of DEI in software environments.
