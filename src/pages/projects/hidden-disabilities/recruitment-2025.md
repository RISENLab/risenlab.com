We investigate software professionals' experiences with chronic pain at work.
**Chronic pain** means pain anywhere in the body that:

- lasts or keeps coming back for **more than 3 months,**
- causes **emotional strain** (like anxiety, frustration, or low mood) and/or **gets in the way of daily life** (work, chores, social activities), 
- and **can't be better explained** by another medical condition.

Chronic pain can seriously affect quality of life and the ability to work. While there's scientific research on software professionals' well-being, the specific challenges of chronic pain are often overlooked. Our study looks at how chronic pain affects software developers' productivity, work routines, thinking and focus, and overall well-being.

## What is involved?

We are interviewing software professionals who live with chronic pain. Before the interview, you’ll complete a short questionnaire about your background, work experience, and pain condition. These questions help us understand who participated; they’re not used for any other purpose.

For more details, see the [information letter](https://surfdrive.surf.nl/files/index.php/s/sYJ66BLeOGDLQfu).
