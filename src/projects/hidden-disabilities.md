The **Invisible Disabilities** project explores how health conditions that are not immediately visible, such as chronic pain, fatigue-related conditions, and neurodivergent traits, shape the experiences of software professionals. Our aim is to understand how these conditions affect work practices, collaboration, and inclusion in software engineering, and to identify ways technology, workplace policies, and other practices can better support affected individuals. The project combines qualitative and empirical studies to build awareness and promote sustainable, inclusive participation in the software teams.

**We are currently recruiting participants for an interview.**
Are you a software developer living with chronic pain like migraines, irritable bowel syndrome, back pain, Crohn's, or fibromyalgia? We want to hear how it impacts your work. Sign up for an interview! Check our [study page](/projects/hidden-disabilities/recruitment-2025) for more info.
