Hi! I'm Pien, a PhD candidate at Radboud University, where I'm exploring the world of Explainable AI for Software Vulnerabilities under supervision of Mairieli Wessel. My research sits at the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence, Cybersecurity and Software Engineering**, three fields that keep technology exciting (and sometimes unpredictable!). 

Software vulnerabilities are a huge challenge for digital security, and while AI can help us detect these bugs, many models act like mysterious black boxes, with confusing outputs. I aim to make these sytems more transparent, interpretable and trustworthy, so that developers understand why a piece of code is flagged as vulnerable. 

I'm especially interested in: 
- Explaining the **root cause** of already identified bugs and **why a suggested fix works** in a way anyone can understand.
- Engage with software engineers to retrieve insights into their **explanatory needs**.
- **Refine and evaluate the quality of explanations** given the results from the case studies with software develoopers.

My research is part of the [_Find2Fix project: Reducing Software Errors using Transparent AI project_](https://www.nwo.nl/en/projects/pihzy95745), where we will engineer the first open-source tool for the entire process from software error discovery to mitigation (and of course explain the results to developers!).
