Hi! I’m **Eduardo Figueredo Pacheco**, a student/researcher focused on **Artificial Intelligence**. My current work involves **AI agent projects** using the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, exploring integrations with **different Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **agent deployment pipelines**.  

I completed my **Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at the University of São Paulo (USP)**, where I developed a strong interest in the intersection of **intelligent systems** and **applied AI research**.  

Beyond research, I also have hands-on experience in **DevOps** and **Cloud Engineering**, which supports my work in developing scalable and reliable AI systems. I’m deeply interested in continuing to explore and advance these fields.
